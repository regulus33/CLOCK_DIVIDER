# Includes

Note all classes other than tests and main.cpp are located here.


Classes prefixed with "Arduino" are generated by a cmake script in the
main parent directory of this project. Those classes are completely segregated
from arduino and embedded libraries. They are pure cpp classes with no dependencies.
You can re-use them if desired.
